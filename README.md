# data-rescaling-and-normalization


It's easy to get confused between scaling and normalization is because the terms are sometimes used interchangeably and they are very similar! In both cases, you're transforming the values of numeric variables so that the transformed data points have specific helpful properties. The difference is that:

* [scaling](https://github.com/tawfikhammad/data-rescaling-and-normalization/tree/main/Scaling) : you're changing the range of your data.
* [normalization](https://github.com/tawfikhammad/data-rescaling-and-normalization/tree/main/normalization) : you're changing the shape of the distribution to normal distributed.
* [standardization(Z-score)](https://github.com/tawfikhammad/data-rescaling-and-normalization/tree/main/standardization) : changing the shape of the distribution to standard normal distributed.
