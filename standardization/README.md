# Standardization (z-score normalization):
Rescaling features so that they are about standard normally distributed is a common alternative to the min-max scaling we talked about above. To do this, we use a process called standardization to change the data so that its mean is 0 and its standard deviation is 1.

**`Note that:`**
* we use Standardization when our data follow normal distributed.
* Standardization can help identfy outliers, data point with Z-score above 3 or 4 is consedered outlier. can be used to calculate P-value and test hyphesis.
